The pull request is validated by Travis CI, a continuous integration service, using the test suite defined by the ballet framework, testing the feature's API and running a streaming logical feature selection (SLFS) algorithm. If the feature is accepted, the GitHub app `ballet-bot` responds by automatically merging the pull request into the project. Otherwise, it automatically closes it. Similarly, after an accepted feature is merged, the CI service runs another ballet-defined script to prune redundant features using the same SLFS algorithm."
